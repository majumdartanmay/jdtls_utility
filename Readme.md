# Introduction

The integration of jdtls and neo vim is bit too hectic. Configuring it with Mason makes it difficult to tweak the JDTLS setup. Setting it up manually takes bit too much effort as well. 

We will be using ANT to perform this. 

## Why ANT?

1. This project is being developed in Windows. We needed an utility which has cross platform capabilities.
3. Latest version of PowerShell is cross-platform. However, I am not sure how compatible it is with older linux and windows OS. 
ANT.
